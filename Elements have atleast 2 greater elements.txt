Elements which have at-least two greater elements
Problem Description

You are given an array of distinct integers A, you have to find and return all elements in array which have at-least two greater elements than themselves.

NOTE: The result should have the order in which they are present in the original array.



Problem Constraints
3 <= |A| <= 105

-109 <= A[i] <= 109



Input Format
First and only argument is an integer array A.



Output Format
Return an integer array containing the elements of A which have at-least two greater elements than themselves in A.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Input 2:

 A = [11, 17, 100, 5]


Example Output
Output 1:

 [1, 2, 3]
Output 2:

 [11, 5]


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 Number of elements greater than 1: 4
 Number of elements greater than 2: 3
 Number of elements greater than 3: 2
 Number of elements greater than 4: 1
 Number of elements greater than 5: 0
 Elements 1, 2 and 3 have atleast 2 elements strictly greater than themselves.
Explanation 2:

 Number of elements greater than 11: 2
 Number of elements greater than 17: 1
 Number of elements greater than 100: 0
 Number of elements greater than 5: 3
 Elements 5 and 11 have atleast 2 elements strictly greater than themselves.








Java:

public class Solution {
    public ArrayList<Integer> solve(ArrayList<Integer> A) {
        ArrayList<Integer> b=new ArrayList<>();
        int largest=0, secondLargest=-1;
         for (int i = 1; i < A.size(); i++) {
        if (A.get(i) > A.get(largest))
            largest = i;
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < A.size(); i++) {
        if (A.get(i) != A.get(largest)) {
            if (secondLargest == -1)
                secondLargest = i;
            else if (A.get(i) > A.get(secondLargest))
                secondLargest = i;
        }
    }
    // System.out.println(largest+" "+secondLargest);
    for(int i=0;i<A.size();i++) {
        if(i!=largest && i!=secondLargest) {
            b.add(A.get(i));
        }
    }
    return b;
    
    }
}
